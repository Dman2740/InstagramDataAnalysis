# SelfHarmProject

This project will consist of taking content outputted from various Social Media Platforms and categorizing the
data through self-implemented code.

In the JsonReader Python File 
  - I first needed to read the Json files that were extracted from Social Media
  - Then I needed to parse it appropriately to find the user profile 
  - Lastly I will display the user profile page on Instagram
